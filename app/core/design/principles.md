# Core Architectural Principles

## 1. Philosophical Grounding
All architectural components must have philosophical justification that explains their essential nature and relationships. This ensures the system has conceptual integrity rather than being merely a collection of pragmatic choices.

## 2. Triadic Structure
Components are organized in triads that follow dialectical progression from abstract to concrete:
- First moment: Abstract universality (thesis)
- Second moment: Particular determination (antithesis)
- Third moment: Concrete individuality (synthesis)

## 3. Logical Foundations
Each triad operates according to its own logical structure:
- Being Triad: Qualitative → Quantitative → Judgmental Logic
- Essence Triad: Identity → Difference → Ground Logic
- Concept Triad: Universal → Particular → Individual Logic

## 4. Clear Boundaries
Each layer has specific responsibilities that must not be violated:
- Base/Quality: Provides identity and temporality
- Entity/Property: Provides domain structure and validation
- Table/Characteristic: Provides storage structure and persistence

## 5. Operational Independence
Higher layers can operate without knowledge of lower implementation details, but lower layers cannot depend on higher ones. This ensures proper abstraction and separation of concerns.

## 6. Syllogistic Completeness
Each triad forms a complete syllogism with thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. No component should exist outside of this structure.

## 7. Quality Precedes Quantity
All quantitative determinations (constraints, validations) must be grounded in qualitative determinations (identity, existence). This ensures that mathematical constraints serve conceptual purposes.

## 8. Determinateness Before Operation
All operations must act upon determinate entities. The determinateness of an entity (its qualities and properties) must be established before operations can be defined upon it.

## 9. Shape as Synthesis
The complete determination of any component is its Shape - the synthesis of its structure and state. All components should provide a Shape representation.

## 10. Design Persistence
Core architectural decisions and their philosophical justifications must be preserved in design documentation, separate from implementation details or tests.
