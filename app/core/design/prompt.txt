so under /lib we have the traditional
/data and /model where the model
is the "data service" where /data contains
the schemas and object definitons.
yesterday new ideas emerged
and this really took us out of
"User Domain" and deep into "System Domain"
and so I wanted a new approach
and so now we introduce
a /being folder which defines system schemas
and a /services which define "object definitions"
at the the level of Being.

we can do a similar thing for Essence next.
but lets review this because it is simpler than Essence,
what are "topical maps" and "essential knowing"
one we have agreed that we can work within this file structure.
I want to make some passes reviewing the code step by step
with test generation.
But first, how do you understand the idea behind
this particular folder and file layout?
