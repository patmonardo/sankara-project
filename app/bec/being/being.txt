# Additional assertions
:Being rdfs:comment """
Pure Being, as conceived by Hegel, represents the most fundamental and abstract concept in his logical system.
It is characterized by its utter simplicity and lack of determination. Key aspects include:

1. Indeterminateness: Being has no specific qualities or characteristics that distinguish it.
2. Immediacy: It is direct and unmediated, prior to any reflection or relation.
3. Self-identity: Being is equal only to itself, with no internal or external differences.
4. Emptiness: In its purity, Being is devoid of any content or structure.
5. Equivalence to pure intuiting and empty thinking: Being corresponds to the most abstract forms of consciousness.

This concept of Being serves as the starting point of Hegel's dialectical logic, providing the basis for the development of more complex and determined concepts.
