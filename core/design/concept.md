# Concept Triad: Field → Form → View

## Logical Structure: The Judgment of Concept

The Concept triad implements the final stage of logical development, where abstract universality becomes concrete through particularity and individuality:

1. **Field (Universal)**: The abstract universal element of user interaction
2. **Form (Particular)**: The particularized collection of fields for specific purposes
3. **View (Individual)**: The concrete individual presentation combining multiple forms

## Field (Universal)

Field represents the universal moment of concept - the atomic unit of user interaction.

### Philosophical Foundation
- **Universal Moment**: Field as abstract universal concept
- **Self-Determination**: Field determines its own behavior
- **Categorical Logic**: Field follows logic of categories (input types)

### Core Concepts
- **ValueField**: Atomic unit of data entry and display
- **ValidationField**: Field with validation logic
- **InteractionField**: Field with user interaction patterns

### Key Responsibilities
- **Value Management**: Handling primitive and complex values
- **Validation**: Enforcing field-level constraints
- **Interaction**: Managing user input and feedback
- **State**: Tracking field state (pristine, dirty, touched, error)

## Form (Particular)

Form represents the particular moment of concept - the organization of fields for specific purposes.

### Philosophical Foundation
- **Particular Moment**: Form as determinate particularity
- **Teleological Structure**: Form organized toward a specific purpose
- **Hypothetical Logic**: Form follows "if-then" logic of procedures

### Core Concepts
- **FormDefinition**: Structure and validation rules
- **FormState**: Runtime state of form entries
- **FormLayout**: Visual organization of fields

### Key Responsibilities
- **Field Coordination**: Managing relationships between fields
- **Validation**: Enforcing form-level constraints
- **State Management**: Tracking overall form state
- **Submission**: Processing complete datasets

## View (Individual)

View represents the individual moment of concept - the concrete presentation that unites universality and particularity.

### Philosophical Foundation
- **Individual Moment**: View as concrete individuality
- **Disjunctive Structure**: View composed of different possible representations
- **Disjunctive Logic**: View follows "either-or" logic of choices

### Core Concepts
- **ViewModel**: Data prepared for presentation
- **ViewTemplate**: Presentation structure
- **ViewState**: Interactive state of the view

### Key Responsibilities
- **Data Presentation**: Rendering data in appropriate format
- **Interaction Management**: Coordinating complex user interactions
- **Navigation**: Managing movement between views
- **Context**: Providing contextual information for interpretation

## Boundaries Between Components

### Field-Form Boundary
- Field provides atomic interaction
- Form provides coordinated purpose
- Boundary is where individual values gain contextual meaning

### Form-View Boundary
- Form provides structured data entry
- View provides complete presentation context
- Boundary is where data entry meets data presentation

## The Syllogistic Movement

### Universal Judgment (Field)
- **Thesis**: Value (what is)
- **Antithesis**: Validation (what should be)
- **Synthesis**: Interaction (what becomes)

### Particular Judgment (Form)
- **Thesis**: Definition (structure)
- **Antithesis**: State (content)
- **Synthesis**: Submission (purpose)

### Individual Judgment (View)
- **Thesis**: Model (data)
- **Antithesis**: Template (presentation)
- **Synthesis**: Interaction (lived experience)

## Integration with Being and Essence

- **Fields** operate on **Properties** from the Entity layer
- **Forms** operate on **Lists** from the List layer
- **Views** operate on **Graphs** from the Graph layer

This completes the vertical integration of our 3x3x3 architecture:
